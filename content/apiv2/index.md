We've rebuilt Vanilla's API from the ground up to enable tighter integrations and lower-level access to all of Vanilla's features using an API-first strategy. The initial release will provide feature partiy with our API v1. New endpoints will become available as they are completed, so watch for new product announcements.

## Key improvements in API v2

- More authentication options, including per-user access tokens.
- Complete, custom API docs in your dashboard, including examples you can use immediately.
- More endpoints so you can control more of your site from the API.
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) support.
- Greater functional consistency, and higher conformance to current industry best practices.
- Better automated testing, to reduce regression bugs and unwanted changes.
