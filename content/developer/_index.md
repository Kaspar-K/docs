## Welcome!

The Developers section is primarily targeted at folks using the **open source product** who have at least a basic understanding of PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Clients of VanillaForums.com (cloud) should [contact support](http://vanillaforums.com/help) to address technical issues. Our hosted product does not allow direct file access to ensure security and performance, which precludes many instructions in this section.

## Security Issues and Responsible Disclosure

Found a security issue? Please contact us at security@vanillaforums.com with full details, including reproduction steps. All other inquiries should go to support@vanillaforums.com This allows us to release a patch as quickly as possible and, hopefully, before knowledge of it becomes widespread. For all other issues, please use the [GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/vanillaforums/vanilla).
