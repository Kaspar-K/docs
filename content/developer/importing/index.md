## Importing to Vanilla

Already have a community on another platform? Great! We have a tool called Vanilla Porter that can help you migrate from many other popular platforms.

[Download Vanilla Porter](https://open.vanillaforums.com/addon/porter-core)

Vanilla Porter is a tool that you can upload to your current web server to run in your web browser. It exports any platform to a generic format that the "Import" option in your new Vanilla Forum can read.

All imports will completely overwrite all data in your forum (including your users), so only import to a fresh forum installation that doesn't have any data you want to save. We recommend backing up your Vanilla database first as an extra precaution.
