## What's accessibility?

Simply put, web accessibility (aka a11y) is about making your website usable by as many people as possible. 

## Who's it for?

This includes, but is not exclusive to:

- Vision Impairments (from partial to full blindness, color blindness, etc)
- Physical disability (lack of physical control, tremors, spasms, etc)
- Cognitive and Sensory (Note that this is the hardest group to help, since it's difficult to quantify)
- Perception (visual: difficulty seeing differences between shapes, or auditory difficulty hard to recognize)
- Memory and Attention
- Sequencing (Difficulty following steps)
- Dyslexia

## Assertive Technology

These above mentioned groups will often use tools to help them use computers. Any tool that helps people use a computer are "Assertive Technology". You might even be using some browser plugins that could fall in this category. An example would be a plugin that bumps up the contrast, or magnifies the page.

### Screen Readers

When people think accessibility, they often think "Screen Reader". A screen reader is a computer program that assists with reading text. They can have additional features for navigation, controlling the cursor, give information about what actions can be taken on an element, etc. Screen readers are not only used by blind users. 

### Desktop 
[JAWS](http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS) is by far the most popular screen reader. It is, however, quite expensive and there is a popular free alternative: [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/). [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/ca/accessibility/mac/vision/) comes packaged with Mac computers, but isn't that great. Any other screen reader for desktop has very small market share.

#### Mobile
Despite the fact that [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/ca/accessibility/mac/vision/) isn't very good on desktop, they really pioneered accessibility on mobile phones. The fast majority of screen reader users on mobile have iPhones [Source](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey7/)


## Navigation

How does a user using a screen reader use a website? Note that many screen reader users do not use a mouse. Part of making your site accessible is to allow keyboard access for everything on the site. However, tabbing through everything on a page is quite long, so there are some alternate ways to navigate content.

Users can call up a dialog that will give them a list of different elements. Here's a non exhaustive lists, seeing as these will vary from one screen reader to the next:
- Headings
- Links
- Landmarks (HTML5 tags for labelling sections: header, main, aside, footer, search, navigation)
- Tables
- Lists
- Buttons
- Forms
- Text Fields
- Images

Once they've selected the item they want in these lists, they'll jump to that section and either read and/or listen to that section. The easiest example to grasp is think of taking all the heading of the page in one list. You'd end up with something very similar to a table of index. Instead of reading the whole page in order, you'd read the titles first, find the section you want to read and jump to that section.
