## FAQ

### What do I do with my existing Advanced Editor posts?

Rich Editor can function side by side with Advanced Editor. Leave Advanced Editor enabled in addition to Rich Editor, and older posts will still be editable using Advanced Editor.

### What causes the warning icon while inserting a Rich Embed?

Some users using browsers with strict privacy settings or adblockers may not be able to load a Rich Embed from certain sites in their browser. The warning icon indicates that all the data necessary to render the embed is present in the editor, but the user's browser is not allowing thet embed to be created.

These embeds will be still be able to load for users with a more permissive browser, even on the same post.

### Why is my published post replaced with "There was an error rendering this rich post"?

This message appears when an a published post was inserted improperly. This can happen through incorrect insertion of a post through the API.

The `Rich` format must be stored in a very particular way. Content from sources other than Rich Editor should not be stored with this format.
