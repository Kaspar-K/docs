## Overview

We strive for maximum accessibility in our product design and take defects in it seriously. Our applications are developed with WCAG 2.0 level AA compliance in mind.

### Key points

* Our default UI is primarily text-based and high-contrast.
* Our interface is keyboard-friendly.
* We limit the use of colors, images, and symbols as navigation aids or primary content.
* We use modern HTML5 markup and accessible forms.
* Not all of Vanilla's add-ons are 100% WCAG 2.0 compliant, usually because we offer newer accessible alternatives.
* We cannot control the accessibility of user generated content within a forum, but we do provide users with the tools to post accessible content.

If you find an area where Vanilla could improve its accessibility, please [contact support](mailto:support@vanillaforums.com) or [file an issue](http://github.com/vanilla/vanilla/issues).

### Section 508

Section 508 is a federal law that requires all electronic and information technology developed, procured, maintained, or used by the federal government be accessible to people with disabilities. Many private businesses also opt to be Section 508 compliant too.

As of Januarary 2017, Section 508 [has adopted WCAG 2.0 level AA success criteria](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-regulatory-impact-analysis#_Toc471376817) for accessibility.

## Theming consideration

<aside class="note">Most Vanilla Forums customize their theme, which can have a huge impact on accessibility.</aside>

Choices of color and font size are obvious considerations, but because our powerful theming engine also allows for the override of HTML markup, it's important to consider that individual sites may vary wildly in their degree of accessibility.

Conversely, themes can also augment the interface to improve Vanilla's core accessibility.
