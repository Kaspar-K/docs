## Customizing Your Forum's Appearance

Your community should have a unique look and feel to match your website, app or product.  The appearance section of your Dashboard lets you control how your community forum will look. 

### Site Title and Logo 

In your Dashboard under Appearance > Banner you can set the following:

 * Home page title
 * Site description
 * Banner title (what is displayed in the browser title bar)
 * Banner logo
 * Mobile banner logo
 * Favicon  (the small logo that appears on the browser tab) 
 * Share image (an image that is sometimes displayed when someone posts a link to your community to a social media site) 

### Homepage 

In your Dashboard under Appearance > Homepage you can set the following:

 * The default homepage view. Typically, the Discussions view is the best choice. If your community is very large, the Categories view might make more sense.  
 * Modern vs table layout. A table layout looks more like traditional forums. 


### Base Theme 

Under Appearance > Themes you can select a base theme for both desktop and mobile devices. All base themes can be further customized by modifying the HTML and overriding the CSS. 

### Avatars 

The Appearance > Avatars page lets you set a default avatar (profile picture).   You can also enable the Vanillicon plugin to create a unique avatar for each member or the Gravatar plugin to use members' Gravatars. 

### Pockets 

Pockets are placeholders where you can add snippets of HTML or Javascript. They are useful for placing ads or widgets throughout your community.
