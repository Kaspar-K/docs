## Developer Support

[VIP plans](https://vanillaforums.com/plans) include developer support, offered for a fixed period of time for a fixed number of individuals in your organization. During that time, those folks can reach out directly to Vanilla developers for advanced assistance in setting up embedding, single sign-on, theming, and appropriate addons & settings.

We will continue to assist you with our outstanding professional support even after your developer support ends. Developer support refers to the elevated frequency, volume, & speed of communication and the direct one-on-one developer access needed during the critical time of your migration to Vanilla or the start of your new community.
