## Moderation Overview

Vanilla tries to make moderation easy by giving you access to many moderation features through the public UI and by inviting members to participate in reporting abuse.  


### Managing Users 

In the Dasboard under the Moderation Tab, you'll be able to lookup users. Clicking on the pencil icon will let you edit a user's profile information, appoint roles and perform a password reset. 

If the Spoof plugin is turned on, you can also spoof this user, i.e. experience Vanilla from that user's point of view. This is useful when trying to replicate a problem this user might be having. 

### Approving Applicants 

If your registration is set to 'Approval' you can approve or reject applicants. 

### Banning Users 

Banning a user is an extreme but sometimes necessary action.  A user can be banned by going to their user profile page or via the Dashboard. There are different ways to ban a user:

 * By email address
 * By username 
 * By IP address 


It it also possible to use wildcards in banning rules by using wildcards,  for example to ban all users with email addresses on the .ru domain, you could create an email ban and enter @*.ru  as the value.  We suggest contacting customer service if you would like to create a wildcard ban 

__Caution:__ using wildcards in banning rules might result in banning large groups of potential users.
