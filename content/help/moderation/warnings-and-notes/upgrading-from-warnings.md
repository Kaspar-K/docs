## Warnings & Notes is version 2

The first version of this addon was titled simply "Warnings". It did not include the User Notes feature. It had more granular controls for Warning a user with particular point levels and durations.

We recommend all users disable the "Warnings" addon if they still have it and immediately enable the "Warnings & Notes" addon instead.

## Why does "Warnings & Notes" have less granular settings?

We discovered that additional options created ambiguity among moderator teams over what an appropriate warning level was for particular user behaviors. By limiting the number of options, we've increased clarity for how to use the feature.
