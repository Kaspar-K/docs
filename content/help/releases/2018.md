### Vanilla 2.6 (5 April 2018)

**Category Following**

* Users may now "Follow" categories.
* Recent Discussions page may be filtered to only show discussions from followed categories.
* This feature must be enabled in the Dashboard. 
* Enabling it adds a new menu to the Recent Discussions page, so theming conflicts should be checked.
* We removed the old "Mute" function for categories to make room for this new feature.

**Hero Image addon**

* Adds theming functionality to easily add a large custom image per page.
* See notes at https://docs.vanillaforums.com/help/addons/hero-image/

**API v2 new endpoint support for the following features:**

* Badges
* Polls

**Changes & Additions:**

* Add Analytics.Data.View permission to grant non-administrators analytics view access.
