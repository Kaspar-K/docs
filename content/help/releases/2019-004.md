#### Custom Theming

_Custom theming for knowledge base is currently **not available for Theme Pull or Code Deploy features.**_
This release lays the groundwork for a new dynamic theming system in Vanilla. Highlights include:

- New _beta_ APIv2 `/themes` endpoints.
- Updated Knowledge Base & Editor UIs to support the new framework.
- Support for setting custom variables through a theme. Currently this allows customization of font properties, button styes, and primary/secondary colour schemes with _no CSS required_.
- Support for 0-modification custom theme headers & footers.
- Support for adding custom javascript through a theme.

#### Deleting and Restoring Knowledge Bases

Knowledge bases can now be deleted and restore from the knowledge base dashboard page (`/knowledge-settings/knowledge-bases`). Currently deleting a knowledge will remove it from visibility everywhere, but **does not permanently delete content.** A deleted knowledge base can restored at a later date.

#### Article Reactions

Signed in users can now React to articles with Yes/No "Was this Helpful?" prompt. Signed out users can see the totals of the prompt, but are not currently able to respond.

#### Next & Previous Articles

Guide type knowledge bases now display nest/previous links at the bottom of the article.
