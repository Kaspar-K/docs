We've added a new paragraph level formatting menu in order to surface more formatting options.

Currently it is broken down into 4 categories.

-   Heading Formats (Displays 4 possible levels of headings).
-   List Formats (Numbered List, Bulleted List, Indented & Outdent).
-   Special Formats (Quote, Code Block, Spoiler).
-   Standard Format

#### New Rich Editor formats

Along with the paragraph formatting menu, we've added support for

-   Additional levels of heading (2, 3, 4, 5). Previously only levels 2 & 3 were available.
-   Support for nested lists. Lists can now be nested up to 4 levels deep.

#### Improved Pasting Robustness

This iteration of Rich Editor see much improved ability to paste content into the editor.

### Image Upload Limits

It is now possible to limit maximum image upload dimensions through and enhanced dashboard posting page. Any images uploaded above this limit will be resized (while preserving aspect ratio) to fit within the configured dimensions.

These dimensions will be respected in Rich Editor, Advanced Editor, and the `/api/v2/media` endpoint.

The following may now be pasted from other web pages

-   Images (multiple at a time, including with mixed content).
-   Lists (Including nested lists).

### New or Expanded API endpoints

#### Set the canonical URL of a discussion

-   `PUT /api/v2/discussions/:id/canonical-url`
-   `DELETE /api/v2/discussions/:id/canonical-url`

#### Expand accepted answer IDs

The `GET /api/v2/discussions/:id` endpoint not offers an expand parameter `acceptedAnswers`. When set the commentID & rendered text of the accepted answer will be included in the response.

#### Current user endpoints

-   `GET /api/v2/users/me`
-   `GET /api/v2/users/me-counts`

These 2 endpoints may be used to fetch information about the currently signed in user.

#### Record a page view

-   `POST /tick`

## Knowledge Base Features

### Community & Knowledge Base Integration

Discussions & Questions may now be converted into knowledge base articles with the new menu item `Convert to article`.

Using this prompt will create a new article draft including the contents of the discussion/question as well as any accepted answers.

After publishing the draft the discussion will be linked to the new article. This is a non-destructive action. After publishing that draft the the community post and the article will be linked together.

This will be reflected on the original discussion by setting the canonical URL of the discussions pages to point to the article. Additionally a notice will displayed to the user indicating the link.

### Knowledge Base Sitemaps

Sites making use of the Sitemaps plugin will now offer an index of all knowledge base articles for search engines.

### Filter by Knowledge Base or Community Category in Search

The `/kb/search` page now include the ability to filter by a single knowledge base while searching knowledge base content and the ability to filter by a category while searching the community.

### Improved Security with CSP

Knowledge base pages now implement `Content-Security-Policy` headers. These headers prevent the loading of scripts from unauthorized script sources. Some domains (such as the site's own domain) are whitelisted by default.

Additional domains may be whitelisted by extending the `ContentSecurityPolicy.ScriptSrc.AllowedDomains` array or implementing a `ContentSecurityPolicyProviderInterface` and registering it with `ContentSecurityPolicyModel`.

### Improved Help Center home page

The home page for Help Center type knowledge bases has been redesigned to make better use of screen space and improve user experience.
