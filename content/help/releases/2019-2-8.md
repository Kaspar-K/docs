The Rich Text Editor features a number of significant upgrades:

- Embedded link previews. When you paste a link, you will see the site's title, description, and a thumbnail image if one is available.
- Better user mentioning experience (All unicode characters supported).
- Pure WYSIWYG. No need to "Preview" your posts because they are always 100% accurate.
- Toolbars that stay with you and only show when you need them. No need to scroll up to find your menus when composing a long post.
- Seamless mobile experience that is just as rich as desktop.
- Enhanced accessibility including full keyboard-based interactions.
- Built-in native emoji support.
- Drag-and-drop image embedding and file attachments.
- Code formatting is now built-in (no other addon needed).
- When you edit old posts, it will continue to use Advanced Editor. We do not yet support the automatic conversion of old posts to the new format.

**Fix limit parameter not being properly validated on APIv2 endpoints:**

This is a rather minor fix on our end, but it may have an impact on your set up if you are using API V2 anywhere on your side and you have a call set up with a limit parameter set higher than 100.

This has always been our suggested limit; however, we were not properly validating that limit parameter. This meant that you could use an API call with a higher limit parameter, and your calls would be successful. The call would only start to return errors once the community had grown to a point where these API calls they set up would then start pulling so may records that it would exacerbate the API and return an error with little to no helpful information.

Vanilla has implemented proper validation of the parameter so that we can return a valid error explaining that the limit should be lower than 100.
