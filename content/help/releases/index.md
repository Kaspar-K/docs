## Cloud release schedule

All SuccessTeamâ„¢ customers receive updates containing new features, bug fixes, and security patches, approximately every other week at a fixed time which is not pre-announced.

Our customers on [Enterprise plans](https://vanillaforums.com/plans) will receive the same updates on a pre-announced & co-ordinated timeline, after the update has already been widely deployed on the rest of Vanilla cloud.

Other plan levels and all staging sites receive these updates on an ad-hoc basis.
