### Making your Community Private 

If you set your community to private, only registered members will be able to view and post.  If a user that is not logged in browses to the community, they will see a login page. 

To make your community private:

 * Go to the Addons page in the Dashboard
 * Turn on the 'Private Community' addon 
 * Click on the addon settings, this will take you to the Roles and Permission page
 * Turn on 'Enable Private Communities'
